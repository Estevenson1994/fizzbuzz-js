# FizzBuzz in Javascript

This is a basic javascript project implementing the rules of FizzBuzz and using the common Javascript testing framework, [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

This project was used as an intro into Javascript.

## The rules:

A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuz".
